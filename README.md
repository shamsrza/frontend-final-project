# frontent-final-project
Collapse in FAQ page doesnt work into structured folder (frontent-final-project) but in separate page it works without any problem. I pushed that separate FAQ page into this repo.
In some pages hover doesnt work but I set all properties in case if it will work in your computer(VS code app).
